# Tasks: MCP Knowledge Server

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mcp-knowledge-server/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per Constitution II (Testing Standards), comprehensive testing is required:
- Unit tests for business logic (minimum 70% coverage, 80% for critical paths)
- Integration tests for component interactions and API contracts
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- All tests must pass before merge (Quality Gates)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 being functional (wraps existing functionality in MCP protocol)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before MCP tool handlers
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1-3 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Processors in US1 can all be developed in parallel
- MCP tool implementations in US4 can be developed in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for Document model validation in tests/unit/test_models/test_document.py"
Task: "Unit test for PDF processor in tests/unit/test_processors/test_pdf_processor.py"
Task: "Unit test for DOCX processor in tests/unit/test_processors/test_docx_processor.py"
Task: "Unit test for text extraction service in tests/unit/test_services/test_text_extractor.py"
Task: "Unit test for OCR service in tests/unit/test_services/test_ocr_service.py"

# Launch all processors for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement PDF processor in src/processors/pdf_processor.py"
Task: "Implement DOCX processor in src/processors/docx_processor.py"
Task: "Implement PPTX processor in src/processors/pptx_processor.py"
Task: "Implement XLSX processor in src/processors/xlsx_processor.py"
Task: "Implement HTML processor in src/processors/html_processor.py"
Task: "Implement image processor in src/processors/image_processor.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full MCP integration!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team tackles User Story 4 together (wraps all functionality)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 110
- Phase 1 (Setup): 8 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 12 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Add Documents): 29 tasks (8 tests + 21 implementation)
- Phase 4 (User Story 2 - Search): 12 tasks (4 tests + 8 implementation)
- Phase 5 (User Story 3 - Manage): 12 tasks (4 tests + 8 implementation)
- Phase 6 (User Story 4 - MCP Integration): 25 tasks (9 tests + 16 implementation)
- Phase 7 (Polish): 12 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45+ tasks can run in parallel within their phases

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (User Story 1 only) = 49 tasks = Functional document ingestion and storage

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Add a PDF, verify storage with knowledge-status
- US2: Search added documents, verify relevant results
- US3: View, remove documents, verify operations
- US4: Connect MCP client, call all tools
