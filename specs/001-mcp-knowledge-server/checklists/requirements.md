# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Knowledge Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Details

**Content Quality**: All items passed
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without HOW
- Uses standard libraries and technologies only in assumptions section
- Written for business stakeholders with clear user-focused language
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: All items passed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (all requirements are clear)
- All 24 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "under 30 seconds", "90% accuracy")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not implementation)
- 26 acceptance scenarios defined across 4 user stories
- 10 edge cases explicitly identified
- Scope clearly bounded to local knowledge management with MCP integration
- 10 assumptions documented covering technology choices

**Feature Readiness**: All items passed
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories cover complete workflow: add → search → manage → integrate
- Measurable outcomes align with user stories (e.g., SC-001 relates to US1)
- Implementation details appropriately isolated in Assumptions section

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. No updates required.
