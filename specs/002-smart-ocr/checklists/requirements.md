## Technology Agnostic Checks

### Implementation Independence
- [x] **No framework mentions in requirements** - Requirements don't specify Python, FastAPI, etc.
- [x] **No database mentions** - Requirements don't mandate ChromaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.
- [x] **No specific tool requirements** - Core requirements independent of Tesseract choice
- [x] **Focus on capabilities, not technologies** - "OCR processing" not "Tesseract execution"

### Appropriate Technical References
- [x] **Technical details in Dependencies section** - Tesseract, pytesseract listed as external dependencies
- [x] **Implementation notes separated** - Implementation considerations in Notes section
- [x] **Configuration references appropriate** - Config keys documented but not mandated

Examples:
- ✅ Requirements: "System MUST support OCR processing of PDF pages as images"
- ✅ Dependencies: "Tesseract OCR: Open-source OCR engine (v4.0+)"
- ❌ Avoided: "System MUST use Tesseract 4.0 with LSTM neural networks"

**Status**: ✅ Properly technology-agnostic with appropriate technical references

---

## User-Centric Checks

- [x] **User pain points identified** - Current problems clearly stated

### User Experience Focus
- [x] **Usability addressed** - Automatic detection, no manual OCR invocation required
- [x] **Feedback mechanisms defined** - Processing method visible in metadata, task status tracking
- [x] **Error handling user-friendly** - Clear error messages for password-protected or corrupted PDFs
- [x] **Performance expectations set** - Response times specified from user perspective

Examples:
- ✅ "Users successfully process scanned PDFs without manual intervention"
- ✅ "User receives confirmation with processing method indicator (OCR used)"
- ✅ "Clear error message indicating password protection prevents processing"

**Status**: ✅ Strong user-centric focus throughout

---

## Testability Checks

### Requirement Verifiability
- [x] **Each requirement has pass/fail criteria** - Can determine if requirement is met
- [x] **Acceptance criteria measurable** - Specific thresholds and metrics provided
- [x] **Test scenarios provided** - User scenarios directly map to test cases
- [x] **Edge cases identified** - Password-protected PDFs, corrupted files, large documents

### Testing Support
